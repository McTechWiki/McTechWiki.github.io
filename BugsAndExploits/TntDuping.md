# tnt duplication

## History
TNT Duplication, or TNT Duping, was first discovered in 1.7 but was not used as it was slightly impractical before the addition of slime blocks.
It gained popularity with the invention of world eaters.
### Opposition
Mojang historically opposes TNT Duping as they consider it an exploit, and tried to fix it, but then have decided to leave it in the game for the time being, due to a lack of replacement method

 for what TNT duping currently does.
## Mechanic
TNT Duping works by using piston pushing behavior to make the TNT both light and move at once, creating a moving TNT block and a TNT entity. The order this follows is:
The piston, in the same tick it powers but before moving, creates a list of the blocks in front of it that need to be moved.
The TNT gets powered. In order to do this, the update that powers it needs to come from
- a moving rail (1.12 and below) being replaced
- anything that pop off from a state update (supporting block removed): coral fan is mostly used because it still create a moving block and can be reused.
If it's a brittle block, that block must not be in front of a moved block because it will be placed in the broken block list that will be handled separately
- a moving lit observer being replaced (works in all versions that have observers)

These specific blocks are able to create a normal update after the list of blocks to be moved is created, but before some of the moved blocks have been removed.
That needs to happen before the TNT block is removed (before a block behind the tnt replaces it, (if there is no blocks, it can be after the moving TNT was created). This update can also be propagated through other blocks, as long as it is instant (for example using rails, dust, noteblocks (1.13+), or TNT itself), which allows for up to 11 TNT to be duplicated using a single piston push, the 12th block being for updating.
The tnt moving block is created from the moved block list regardless of the original tnt being ignited or not, and this means that the TNT is preserved in block form.
